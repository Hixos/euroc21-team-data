This data is from ARIS' first pitot tube. 

The data recorded is pressure at the tip of the tube and at its sides. By comparing both pressure readings one can calculate the velocity of the rocket through the bernoulli equations. 

The pdf shows the calculation and the raw csv file shows the estimated velocity which seems to be a good estimate.

After the increase of pressure at the tip around 1.5 seconds the rocket flips and hence the data recorded from the pitot tube is not usable after this point.
